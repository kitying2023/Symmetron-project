The belt is fitted tightly around the pelvis, over the sacrum and below the anterior superior iliac spines (ASISs) to prevent opening the joint. (The upper part of the innominate bones flares out so pushing them inwards will move the lower part outwards, away from the sacrum, opening the sacroiliac joints, increasing their instability). They will use this belt for activities which have in the past precipitated back pain. They will be reassessed one month later.

At that time they will be given the exercises to correct their sacroiliac malrotation and the concurrent use of both treatments will be assessed at their last visit one month later.",Immediate use of pelvic support belt

NCT01611792,74570433,Stabilization exercise protocol,"The stabilization exercise protocol consists of exercises focused on improving the ability of trunk muscles to stabilize the spine, beginning with training to isolate the deeper abdominal muscles as well as deep dorsal trunk muscles. Then patients were progressed to exercises that added leverage of the limbs while maintaining the co-contraction of the deeper abdominal muscles and deep dorsal trunk muscles while breathing normally. Various positions (e.g., supine and quadruped positions) were used to challenge the patients based on their tolerance. Finally, patients were progressed to exercises in more functional positions that included tasks/activities that were reported as challenging and/or painful; patients performed the tasks at the speed demanded by the particular task. Maintenance of the co-contraction of deep trunk muscles was emphasized during these functional activities.",Stabilization
NCT01611792,74570434,Strength and conditioning exercise protocol,"This protocol contained trunk strengthening and endurance exercises. It consisted of 3 phases: 1) initial strengthening of trunk flexors/extensors in single plane movements, 2) trunk and lower-extremity stretching as well as progression of trunk-strengthening exercises to include multi-planar trunk movements. Aerobic exercises were progressed as tolerated and patient education about body biomechanics were reinforced, and 3) trunk-strengthening exercises under dynamic conditions (e.g., unstable support surface and in multi-planar trunk movements). During the 10 week protocol, exercises became more challenging, and each subject had to complete at least the first phase before moving onto the next phase in order to be included in post-testing analyses. There was no specific focus on the deep abdominal or deep dorsal trunk muscles during any of these exercises.",Strengthening and Conditioning
