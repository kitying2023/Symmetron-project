First there is an analysis of and instruction in modifying a subject's direction-specific alignment and movement strategies during symptomatic functional activities. Second, there is education about the principles of tissue injury and healing, and how cumulative tissue stress contributes to microtrauma and LBP. Unique to the education process is the emphasis on how using one's particular movement strategies during functional activities may accelerate tissue stress accumulation because the strategies are used repetitively. Thirdly, there is exercise prescription that includes practice in performing modified versions of the direction-specific impairment tests from the physical exam, with an emphasis on impairments that can be modified to eliminate LBP symptoms.",'Eligible' Subject Group - MSI

NCT03502187,74261425,Progressive Exercise Plan,"The goal of PEP is to reduce back pain, disability, and improve trunk flexibility, strength and endurance through controlled, gradual, progressive back exercises. PEP teaches muscle strengthening exercises and self-management strategies to promote back fitness. PEP sessions provide a standardized self-management framework for performing the exercises at home. PEP is performed every other day/week for about ~1 hour over a period of 9 weeks. PEP consists of 3 sequential phases with each phase lasting 3 weeks. Exercises become progressively more difficult and intense, focusing on back stretching and strengthening that progressively load and unload the lumbar spine by means of flexion/extension exercises.

NCT01611792,73749561,Stabilization exercise protocol,"The stabilization exercise protocol consists of exercises focused on improving the ability of trunk muscles to stabilize the spine, beginning with training to isolate the deeper abdominal muscles as well as deep dorsal trunk muscles. Then patients were progressed to exercises that added leverage of the limbs while maintaining the co-contraction of the deeper abdominal muscles and deep dorsal trunk muscles while breathing normally. Various positions (e.g., supine and quadruped positions) were used to challenge the patients based on their tolerance. Finally, patients were progressed to exercises in more functional positions that included tasks/activities that were reported as challenging and/or painful; patients performed the tasks at the speed demanded by the particular task. Maintenance of the co-contraction of deep trunk muscles was emphasized during these functional activities.",Stabilization
NCT01611792,73749562,Strength and conditioning exercise protocol,"This protocol contained trunk strengthening and endurance exercises. It consisted of 3 phases: 1) initial strengthening of trunk flexors/extensors in single plane movements, 2) trunk and lower-extremity stretching as well as progression of trunk-strengthening exercises to include multi-planar trunk movements. Aerobic exercises were progressed as tolerated and patient education about body biomechanics were reinforced, and 3) trunk-strengthening exercises under dynamic conditions (e.g., unstable support surface and in multi-planar trunk movements). During the 10 week protocol, exercises became more challenging, and each subject had to complete at least the first phase before moving onto the next phase in order to be included in post-testing analyses. There was no specific focus on the deep abdominal or deep dorsal trunk muscles during any of these exercises.",Strengthening and Conditioning
